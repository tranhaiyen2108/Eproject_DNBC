		<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said Wednesday it plans to reopen its North American auto plants on May 4, extending its current shutdown by two additional weeks.</p>
		<p>The Japanese automaker cited the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and decline in vehicle demand to extend the halt of production at all of its automobile and components plants in Canada, Mexico and the United States.</p>
		<p>Toyota will not furlough its direct employees, but has asked its hourly plant employees to take two days out of the 10 day extension as paid time off or they can go without pay if they don’t have accrued leave.</p>
		<p>For Toyota’s 5,000 workers provided by outside agencies, Toyota is releasing those workers back to their agencies. Toyota will continue to pay the benefits of those workers for the time being, and they may be eligible for unemployment.</p>
		<p>On Tuesday, Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co on Tuesday said they had furloughed thousands of workers at their U.S. operations as the coronavirus pandemic slashes demand for cars in the country.</p>
		<p>A spokesman for Honda, which employs about 18,400 workers at plants in Alabama, Indiana and Ohio, said the Japanese automaker would guarantee salaries through Sunday, having suspended operations on March 23. The plants will be closed through May 1.</p>
		<p>Nissan said it was temporarily laying off about 10,000 U.S. hourly workers effective April 6. It has suspended operations at its U.S. manufacturing facilities through late April due to the impact of the outbreak.</p>
		<p>Automakers are facing a dramatic drop in sales in the United States, the world’s second-largest car market, after some states barred dealers from selling new cars while “stay-at-home” orders are in place. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on Monday extended its shutdown of U.S. and Canadian plants until May 4.</p>',2),

To generate cash, the No. 2 U.S. automaker had said last week it was poised to restart production at some plants in North America as early as April 6, bringing back such profitable vehicles as its top-selling F-150 full-sized pickup, the Transit commercial van and SUVs. But on Tuesday, Ford said that although it had been aiming to resume production at several key U.S. plants on April 14, it would now do so at dates to be announced later on. "The health and safety of our workforce, dealers, customers, partners and communities remains our highest priority, Kumar Galhotra president of Fords North American operations, said in a statement. Still, the automaker will open a plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan, during the week of April 20, that will make ventilators to treat patients afflicted by the coronavirus. Michigan, which is home to a large portion of the U.S. automotive industry, has also become a hot spot in the pandemic. Schools and all but essential businesses have been ordered closed through at least April 13 to slow the spread of the coronavirus. "Today decision by Ford is the right decision for our members, their families and our nation," UAW President Rory Gamble said in a statement. Rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said last week it plans to resume production in North America on April 13. A spokeswoman for FCA said the automaker was "continuing to monitor the situation."General Motors Co has shuttered its plants indefinitely and has not provided a date for vehicle production to restart. "Once it is safe to resume production, we will do so," a GM spokesman said.',2),

"These talks are fluid and ongoing to ensure safe protocols are followed when the companies reopen," UAW President Rory Gamble said in a statement. Detroits automakers and the UAW have been engaged in talks since earlier this month, while local union leaders said on Monday that any worker who feels sick must be allowed to self-quarantine without losing pay. A General Motors spokesman said on Wednesday that the company has developed "screening, cleaning and social strategies" for all facilities in line with input from the UAW and guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The safety practices and sick-leave policies the automakers and the UAW agree to would offer a template for auto suppliers and potentially other manufacturing industries.',2),
	('y5','Coronavirus drives US March auto sales off a cliff','U.S. new vehicle sales likely drove off a cliff in March as the coronavirus pandemic pounded consumer confidence and shuttered dealerships across much of the country, and sales are likely to take a further beating in April as social distancing guidelines remain in place.','Nick Carey','2020-03-31','U.S. new vehicle sales likely drove off a cliff in March as the coronavirus pandemic pounded consumer confidence and shuttered dealerships across much of the country, and sales are likely to take a further beating in April as social distancing guidelines remain in place. "When you look at March, we basically lost half the month," said Eric Lyman, chief industry analyst at car-shopping website TrueCar.com . TrueCar has forecast a sales drop for March of 37 percent and Lyman said sales in April could also be off between 50 percent to 60 percent. A rebound for the sector will likely depend on how long the crisis lasts and what level of support the U.S. government provides for consumers in the meantime. Most major automakers, including General Motors Co and Toyota Motor Corp , are due to report quarterly U.S. sales on April 1. Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV will report sales on April 2. Tesla Inc also typically reports first quarter deliveries during the week after the quarter ends. Analysts had expected the company to deliver about 93,000 vehicles during the quarter, according to Refinitiv. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk on March 19 suspended production at the companys Fremont, California, assembly plant under pressure from local authorities. Just how bad March was is an open question. Cox Automotive did not release a monthly forecast, but said its data showed that on March 27, new vehicle sales to consumers fell 55 percent versus the same day in 2019. In U.S. states under "stay-at-home" orders, sales fell as much as 80 percent to 90 percent, Cox estimated. Those include states like California and New York, home to a large portion of the American car-buying population. "April will be just as dismal," said Cox analyst Michelle Krebs. IHS Markit estimates the coronavirus pandemic will cut full-year 2020 sales by 15.3 percent and globally sales will fall 12 percent - "considerably worse" than the fall in sales during the Great Recession in 2008-2009. More dealers are embracing online sales, which could help mitigate falling sales. But U.S. consumer confidence plunged in March to the lowest level since October 2016 as the coronavirus epidemic upended life for Americans. George Augustaitis, director of automotive industry analytics at CarGurus Inc , an online marketplace for new and used cars, said a rebound in new vehicle sales will depend on government support for workers laid off during the crisis. "If these consumers are taken care of, we should see the market rebound fairly quickly," Augustaitis said.',2),

To generate cash, the No. 2 U.S. automaker was poised to restart production at some plants in North America as early as April 6, bringing back such profitable vehicles as its top-selling F-150 full-sized pickup, the Transit commercial van and SUVs. To conserve cash, Ford announced belt-tightening moves, including temporarily cutting top executives salaries. This came a day after Standard & Poors downgraded the Dearborn, Michigan-based companys debt to "junk" status and warned more downgrades could be necessary."The actions we are taking now are wide-ranging and substantial," Chief Executive Jim Hackett told employees in an email early on Thursday. "We hope they will be enough to give Ford the financial flexibility to ride out the economic and business effects of the coronavirus."The coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 21,000 people globally, has forced the shutdown of auto plants around the world. The outbreak has put pressure on companies, including Ford, which previously drew down credit lines to build its cash position and suspended its dividend. The U.S. Senate on Wednesday passed a US$2 trillion economic rescue package to help unemployed workers and companies, including the auto industry, hit hard by the outbreak. U.S. President Donald Trump, concerned about the economic repercussions of an extended shutdown, has said he wants America to get back to business by Easter, or April 12. GENERATING CASH To get more cash coming in, Ford said Thursday it would restart key plants, while introducing additional safety measures to protect returning workers from the coronavirus. It said it would detail the additional measures later. Ford also took additional moves to conserve cash, announcing its top 300 executives would defer 20per cent to 50per cent of salaries for at least five months starting May 1, with the executive chairman deferring his entire salary. Hackett will defer half his salary. Hackett said Fords goal was to avoid layoffs during the crisis, but warned that could change if the impact of the outbreak is more severe than anticipated. Other actions Ford is taking to conserve cash include deferring salary increases more broadly, suspending overtime for salaried employees and freezing hiring in non-critical areas, Hackett said. However, Ford employees will continue to get healthcare coverage and those exposed to the virus and placed in quarantine will get paid time off, he added. General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) previously said they would shut their North American operations through March 30 and then reassess after that. FCA on Thursday extended its shutdown through April 13, while its parts distribution centers will continue to operate with paid volunteers. Mexico status is subject to a separate announcement.GM on Thursday extended its shutdown indefinitely with no firm restart dates, but said it would evaluate the situation on a week-to-week basis. The automaker said near-term programs like its redesigned full-size SUVs, electric vehicles such as the Cruise Origin, and new Ultium battery "will continue as planned." But it will adjust timing and milestones of other future programs "as necessary" to conserve cash, it added. United Auto Workers President Rory Gamble said Thursday the union viewed announcements like Fords with concern, and any decision to restart production should be based on data and each state position with regards to the coronavirus outbreak."The only guideline in a boardroom should be management asking themselves, "Would I send my family - my own son or daughter - into that plant and be 100per cent certain they are safe?" he said in a statement. The UAW has said three union members who worked at FCA plants have died due to the coronavirus. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer issued an order on Monday barring non-essential businesses from operating until April 13. Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co Ltd said on Thursday it would resume work at its U.S. and Canadian plants on April 7. Meanwhile, Japan Toyota Motor Corp said it would extend a shutdown of its North American plants for two weeks, through April 17. Ford plans to begin production on one shift at its Hermosillo, Mexico, assembly plant, where it builds the Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ sedans. It will restart production on April 14 at its Dearborn plant that builds the F-150 and a Kentucky plant that makes the Super Duty version of the pickup as well as the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs. Other assembly and parts plants will restart then as well. Ford shares closed down 2.4per cent, while GM rose 4.8per cent.',2),
	('y7','Detroit automakers, UAW agree to curb production to contain coronavirus','The Detroit Three automakers and United Auto Workers agreed on Tuesday to curtail production at U.S. factories and limit the number of workers on the job at one time to prevent the spread of the coronavirus among roughly 150,000 factory employees.','Rachit Vats','2020-03-12','The Detroit Three automakers and United Auto Workers agreed on Tuesday to curtail production at U.S. factories and limit the number of workers on the job at one time to prevent the spread of the coronavirus among roughly 150,000 factory employees. The union and the automakers agreed to "rotating partial shutdown of facilities, extensive deep cleaning of facility and between shifts, extended periods between shifts, and extensive plans to avoid member contact," the union said in a statement. The agreement came hours after UAW President Rory Gamble went public with his dissatisfaction with how General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV had responded to his proposal on Sunday that the companies stop production in the face of the coronavirus threat. Gamble warned he would take unilateral action if the automakers did not do more to secure hourly workers on factory floors. The tension between the UAW and the Detroit automakers highlighted a divide in the U.S. labor force that extends well beyond the auto industry. The automakers have allowed salaried employees whose tools are design software and spreadsheets to work from home to reduce their risks of exposure. But the companies had required factory workers whose hands assemble the vehicles to come work in buildings where thousands labor side by side, and congregate in break areas and cafeterias. Gamble had told the automakers on Sunday that they should shut U.S. factories for two weeks, and made that position public early Tuesday. The agreement reached after talks late Tuesday allows the automakers to keep building profitable models such as Fords F-150 pickup, Fiat Chryslers Jeep Wrangler and GMs Cadillac Escalade at a reduced pace. The compromise is less costly than a full shutdown that would have forced the automakers to forego billions in revenue during the current quarter. U.S. vehicle sales are likely to slow as consumers are urged, or forced, to stay home in many states. Slowing production could avoid building up inventories of vehicles that would have to be discounted later. Ford said on Tuesday it had to temporarily stop production of sport utility vehicles at a plant in Chicago because of parts shortages. The UAW said the automakers also agreed to "work with us in Washington, D.C., on behalf of our members as we manage the disruption in the industry." The unions statement did not elaborate on what it wants from the U.S. government, but a parade of industries is forming in the capital seeking assistance as coronavirus lockdowns threaten the economy. Separately, GM and Ford disclosed Tuesday that they each have had one employee, both working at U.S. engineering centers, test positive for coronavirus. They marked the first confirmed cases of coronavirus among the automakers U.S. employees. While GM said that its affected employee was based at its Michigan technical center, the UAW separately said the GM worker was a member of the union. GM said its medical team was working to speak with co-workers who may have had direct contact with the infected employee, and they will be told to self-quarantine for 14 days. GM officials learned the employee had tested positive for the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness on Monday, after the company had issued an order that salaried employees should work from home. Access to the building where the employee worked was restricted, and the building was cleaned, GM spokesman Jim Cain said Tuesday. At Ford, the company said an employee working at a product development office in Dearborn, Michigan, was exposed to coronavirus after leaving work several days ago, and was diagnosed before returning to work. "This person was not at the workplace at that building or any other facility, " Ford spokesman T.R. Reid said Tuesday.',2),

The carrier is in the process of returning its two 18-year-old Beechcraft Beech 1900Ds to their lessor, having already served notice of lease termination, Singh tells Cirium. He declined to name the lessor. Singh adds the lockdown has made it difficult to return the aircraft. The airline’s Beechcrafts – which, according to Cirium fleets data, formerly flew with a now-defunct subsidiary of Air New Zealand – are described by Singh as “very old and very tired ”. “We have taken this as an opportunity for newer aircraft,” he adds. “We are talking to an OEM, but nothing has been signed yet so I can’t disclose anything.” Pressed on whether he is talking to Airbus or Boeing, Singh says he is not talking with either of them, and that the type he is looking at is a “smaller commuter aircraft”. On 5 April, Air Deccan – which has history dating back to 2003, and was once a part of ill-fated Kingfisher Airlines – announced that it was suspending operations until further notice. It was the first Indian carrier to cease operations amid the coronavirus pandemic. All employees were put on “sabbatical” without pay, though Singh says they will be given “right of first refusal” to rejoin the company once it starts operations again. “We took a very early call in doing that,” he says, referring to management’s decision to shutter the airline. “I sat down with shareholders and we knew which direction this was going to go. We sat down and took a conscious call and took a very quick decision that coronavirus was going to stay for the next three to six months. “The question we had to ask was could we sustain ourselves with no revenues coming in? If we could somehow subsidise the aviation business from my shareholder’s other businesses – but the problem is all other business have come to a halt. We can’t keep pumping in money when there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Look what happened to Virgin Australia. The situation compared to other Indian carriers is not anyway extra bad for us; it’s just we saw that coming quickly.” The airline got off to a rocky start in 2003, having to abandon its inaugural flight carrying Indian dignitaries due to an engine fire during taxi. Despite that, it managed to grow its fleet and route network, and in 2008 completed a merger with now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines. Under its new owner, Air Deccan was rechristened Kingfisher Red, but its high operating costs and low yields proved to be a drag on Kingfisher. In 2011 Kingfisher Airlines, which not long after went belly-up, decided to phase out Kingfisher Red. Air Deccan founder GR Gopinath, who has been dubbed “the man who got India’s middle class to fly”, managed to retain the airline’s name by registering for it soon after the rebranding, Forbes India reports. Air Deccan made a comeback in December 2017 when it was granted a flying permit from India’s civil aviation regulator to conduct flights under the country’s UDAN regional connectivity scheme, Business Standard reported at the time. The first three routes were from Mumbai to Nashik, Pune and Jalgaon, according to Forbes India. ',2),

On Monday, for the first time on record, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the U.S. oil benchmark, plunged below zero and into negative territory. Before Monday, many thought this was impossible. Maybe, just maybe, it could drop to zero, effectively erasing all value. But negative territory seemed unimaginable, not least because it’s hard even to wrap one’s mind around it. Pay someone to take your oil? Yet that’s exactly what happened. “It was a take-your-breath-away kind of scary moment,” said Rebecca Babin, managing director at CIBC Private Wealth Management. “It truly was like watching … a full speed train wreck. But you couldn’t stop watching.” The coronavirus pandemic has sapped as much as a third of worldwide demand for oil, according to some estimates. Producers have continued to pump, but with air travel halted and people staying home there’s simply nowhere for this oil to go. Refiners certainly don’t want it. And worldwide storage — both onshore and offshore — is quickly filling up. Analysts warn that we could reach tank tops, or maximum capacity, in a matter of weeks. Everything came to a head on Monday. WTI has a physical settlement, meaning that as the monthly contract reaches expiration, whoever holds the contract is due a physical barrel of oil. Traders, in an effort to profit from the differential, buy and sell contracts without any intention of holding them at expiration, while refiners and airlines are among those on the other side who actually want the oil. The contract that plunged into negative territory was for May delivery. Demand isn’t expected to rebound any time soon. And with nowhere to put the oil, people were left scrambling and ultimately would do anything — in this case, even pay — to have it taken off their hands. There are nuances, of course. For one, the May contract expired on Tuesday, meaning that trading volume was thin as it plunged into negative territory. By that point the contract for June delivery was much more actively traded and thus a better indication of where the Street viewed oil prices. Negative prices themselves are also not completely without precedent. Natural gas, for instance, has traded below zero in the past, and in the physical market certain regional grades of crude were already trading in negative territory prior to Monday. And there were some traders who warned that, as storage filled, prices would continue to decline dramatically. But it was still shocking, nonetheless, to watch the downward descent on Monday of the world’s most actively traded oil contract. “This is an industry that I’ve been a part of for a long time now, and when it gets broken like that, or you get a really bad situation like that, it draws all kinds of unwanted attention and people getting hurt,” said Again Capital founding partner John Kilduff. A slow and then sudden unwind When the futures market opened at 6 p.m. ET on Sunday night, the WTI contract for May delivery traded at $17.73, or about 3% below its Friday settle price of $18.27. Oil was coming off its sixth straight day of losses, and its seventh negative week in eight. The nearly 20% decline for the week was especially notable since, only days before, OPEC and its oil-producing allies had agreed to a historic production cut that would take 9.7 million barrels per day — roughly 10% of global supply — offline. It wasn’t enough to assuage investor fears.',3),
	('y12','Billionaire investor Howard Marks calls the oil crash ‘completely rational’','While a plunge in U.S. crude oil prices this week reverberated across global financial markets and fueled renewed worries over the beleaguered shale oil industry, billionaire investor Howard Marks told CNBC that the price action “is completely rational.”','Tanvir Gill','2020-04-22','A plunge in U.S. crude oil prices this week reverberated across global financial markets and fueled renewed worries over the beleaguered shale oil industry. Yet billionaire investor Howard Marks isn’t panicking. Marks, who co-founded Oaktree Capital Management, told CNBC in an email interview that the weakness in crude oil prices was steeped in fundamentals as energy demand has cratered due to the coronavirus pandemic and buyers are scrambling to stockpile crude oil due to storage space becoming scarce. “It’s not a panic. The move is completely rational,” Marks told CNBC in an emailed statement. “The ultimate complication is that storing oil costs money, and storage facilities aren’t unlimited.  Right now storage is scarce and thus expensive, so it’s not worth it to buy oil today and store it.  The cost of storing exceeds the value today; thus the price is negative,” Marks said. The comments from Marks come after West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery fell more than 100% to settle at negative $37.63 per barrel on Monday, which meant that traders were effectively having to pay to get oil taken off their hands. That marked the first time that the price of an oil futures contract had turned negative. The May WTI contract, which expired on Tuesday, settled at $10.01 a barrel. Futures contracts trade by the month. The June contract is currently trading around $11 per barrel. Meanwhile, international benchmark Brent crude stood at $17.01, nearly 12% lower. The coronavirus pandemic has dealt a severe blow to economic activity around the globe and sapped demand for oil. While OPEC and its oil-producing allies finalized a historic agreement earlier this month to cut production by 9.7 million barrels per day beginning May 1, experts reckon that the reduction in supply won’t be enough to offset the diminution in demand. The International Energy Agency, for instance, warned in its closely-watched monthly report, that demand in April could be 29 million barrels per day lower than a year ago, hitting a level last seen in 1995. “Oil production can’t just be turned off, because for production some wells depend on pressure that a shut-off complicates. So, oil is coming out of the ground that exceeds the amount needed for consumption,” Marks said. The gloominess in the oil market has also put the spotlight on US shale oil producers that are grappling with feeble demand on one hand and a lack of storage on the other, a conundrum that is making desperate oil companies “pay” traders for taking oil off them. However, there are potential signs of relief. Some far-dated contracts this year are showing average oil prices of $20 a barrel and above while contracts expiring in 2021 are reflecting a modest bounce in demand taking prices to near $30 per barrel. Marks spotted a semblance of rationality in those prices. “Oil can be bought for delivery by month. The negative price for oil reflects the excess of supply over demand, plus the cost of storage.  The price for oil in future months (when consumption may have rebounded) is at more normal levels,” he said.',3),
	('y13','OPEC and allies finalize record oil production cut after days of discussion','OPEC and its oil producing allies finalized an agreement to cut production by 9.7 million barrels per day — the single largest output cut in history.','Pippa Stevens','2020-04-12','OPEC and its oil producing allies on Sunday finalized a historic agreement to cut production by 9.7 million barrels per day, following days of discussions among the world’s largest energy producers. It’s the single largest output cut in history. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, fell 1.54% on Monday to settle at $22.41 per barrel. Brent crude traded 34 cents higher at $31.82. Sunday’s emergency meeting — the second in four days — came as oil-producing nations scrambled to reach an agreement in an effort to prop up falling prices as the coronavirus outbreak hammers demand. The agreement ends a Saudi Arabian-Russian price war that broke out at the beginning of March and had pressured oil prices as each sought to gain market share. On Thursday, OPEC+ proposed cutting production by 10 million barrels per day — amounting to some 10% of global oil supply — but Mexico opposed the amount it was being asked to cut, holding up the final deal. Talks continued on Friday when energy ministers from the Group of 20 major economies met, and while all agreed that stabilization in the market is needed, the group stopped short of discussing specific production numbers. Under OPEC+’s new agreement, Mexico will cut 100,000 bpd, a quarter of what it had been asked to cut on Thursday. The 9.7 million bpd cut will begin on May 1 and will extend through the end of June. The cuts will then taper to 7.7 million bpd from July through the end of 2020, and 5.8 million bpd from January 2021 through April 2022. The 23-nation group will meet again on June 10 to determine if further action is needed. “This is at least a temporary relief for the energy industry and for the global economy,” Rystad Energy’s head of analysis Per Magnus Nysveen told CNBC in an email. “Even though the production cuts are smaller than what the market needed and only postpone the stock building constraints problem, the worst is for now avoided.” President Donald Trump, who has been heavily involved in brokering a Saudi Arabian-Russian price war, said in a tweet that it’s a “great deal for all” that “will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States.” On Friday, when the deal was in jeopardy, Trump said the U.S. would cut production in an effort to get Mexico “over the barrel.” At a White House press briefing, Trump said he spoke to Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and had agreed to “pick up some of the slack” by cutting production on behalf of Mexico. He did not elaborate on how the cuts would be enacted, and said Mexico would reimburse the U.S. at a later date. OPEC+ is hoping that nations outside of the group, including the U.S., Canada and Norway, will also cut production to shore up prices. While Trump previously stopped short of saying the U.S. would scale back production, he has noted that market forces would naturally curb output. U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette reiterated this point on Friday, saying that about 2 million bpd and perhaps 3 million bpd of U.S. production would have been taken offline by the end of the year. “Today’s crisis transcends the interests of any one nation and requires a swift and decisive response from us all. Failure to act has far reaching consequences to each of our economies,” he said Friday at the G-20 meeting. “This is a time for all nations to seriously examine what each can do to correct the supply/demand imbalance,” he added.',3),
	('y14','America’s ‘clean energy’ workforce projected to fall by 15% in months ahead','This year looks set to pose a number of challenges for the renewables sector, many of them connected to Covid-19. The coronavirus pandemic has caused issues with supply chains and forced some factories to shut.','Anmar Frangoul','2020-04-15','Over 106,000 people working in the U.S. “clean energy” sector lost their jobs in March as the industry struggled to soften the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, it was claimed Wednesday. The analysis of Department of Labor data, released by Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2), the American Council on Renewable Energy, E4TheFuture and BW Research Partnership, paints a challenging picture for the industry. For the purposes of the analysis, the term “clean energy” encompasses a range of areas including: renewables such as solar and wind; energy storage; energy efficiency; and “clean fuels.”. It shows that, last month, 106,472 people working in clean energy roles filed for unemployment benefits. Looking further ahead, the analysis projects that over 500,000 people working in clean energy — 15% of the sector’s workforce — will lose their jobs in the following months unless “quick and substantive action” is taken by both the administration of President Donald Trump and Congress. “The economic fallout from COVID-19 is historic in both size and speed,” Phil Jordan, vice president and principal at BW Research Partnership, said in a statement issued alongside the analysis. Jordan explained that activities, from the manufacture of electric vehicles to the installation of solar panels, were being impacted. “And the data pretty clearly indicate that this is just the beginning,” he added. Wednesday’s figures are a heavy blow for an industry that added over 70,000 jobs in 2019. The clean energy workforce in the U.S. grew to almost 3.4 million people at the end of last year, according to E2′s Clean Jobs America 2020 report, which was also released on Wednesday. This year looks set to pose a number of challenges for the renewables sector, many of them connected to the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused issues with supply chains and forced some factories to shut. In a blog post toward the end of March, Abigail Ross-Hopper, the president and CEO of the U.S.-based Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), wrote that the solar industry was “at risk.” Citing a survey carried out with the SEIA’s member companies, Ross-Hopper said data showed that “solar companies and workers are losing business and being put out of work by COVID-19.” Last week, research and consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie said global solar installations for 2020 had been revised down from 129.5 gigawatts (GW) to 106.4 GW, which represents an 18% drop compared to pre-coronavirus levels. In the wind energy sector, last week also saw Danish wind turbine manufacturer Vestas suspend guidance for 2020, noting that the global spread of Covid-19 and national measures taken to contain it had caused disruptions to installations, manufacturing and its supply chain. “The situation changes daily and my colleagues’ ability to adapt fast and follow our extensive safety measures have been key to keeping performance in the first quarter in line with expectations,” Henrik Andersen, Vestas’ group president and CEO, said in the statement. “Unfortunately, the pandemic continues to spread and with no clear prognosis on when key wind markets such as the USA, Brazil and India will recover, we are suspending our guidance due to the poor visibility for the remainder of the year.”',3),
	('y15','No more hamburgers? How ‘clean meat’ could transform our diets','Some consumers are now trying to move away from meat, choosing plant-based alternatives instead.','Anmar Frangoul','2020-03-27','For many, the hamburger’s combination of bun, meat and salad is the perfect marriage of simplicity, flavor and familiarity. Whether it’s a gourmet patty with shavings of truffle, or a cheap and cheerful offering from a fast food outlet, today’s diners are spoilt for choice. Our hunger for burgers does, however, have an impact on the environment. Take ground beef: it’s one of the key ingredients in a burger and comes from rearing cattle. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has previously said that emissions from global livestock amount to an estimated 7.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent each year. Breaking things down, cattle — reared for beef, milk and manure, among other things — represent roughly 65% of emissions from the livestock sector. Olivier De Schutter, co-chair of the Brussels-based International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES-Food), said meat production has a major impact on climate change through three channels. “First of all, livestock ruminates, and large amounts of methane gas is the result,” he told CNBC. “Secondly, we need to produce feedstock for the animals — maize, soy beans in particular — and for this we need to clear large forest areas, so deforestation is driven by livestock production,” he added. “And thirdly, we need to produce fertilizers to grow the soy beans, the maize from which this feedstock shall be made, and that too is a source of greenhouse gas emissions.” Plant-based pattie Given the above, it’s perhaps unsurprising that some consumers are now trying to move away from meat, choosing plant-based alternatives instead. Brands are making changes, too. Burger King, for example, now offers customers an Impossible Whopper made using a plant-based meat substitute from Impossible Foods. Elsewhere, fried-chicken giant KFC has used a plant based chicken substitute from Beyond Meat. Back in 2014, Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown spoke to CNBC.  “Meat, as we understand it today, is from cows, pigs, chicken and such,” he explained. “But if you look at what meat is, in terms of its constituent parts, and you break it down into amino acids, fats, water...trace minerals and carbohydrates, those things are not exclusive to animal protein, they’re not exclusive to animal muscle,” he added. “The aim is to collect those from the plant kingdom and assemble them in exactly the way that muscle assembles them.” Meat without a farm? While plant-based meat substitutes have become an intriguing menu option, lab-cultivated produce could also provide a way of giving people their “meat fix” without having to worry about the environment. “We can take a biopsy from an animal… a few cells from an animal (and) bathe those cells in nutrients,” Bruce Friedrich told CNBC. He’s executive director of The Good Food Institute, a non-profit focused on plant-based alternatives to animal products and so-called “clean meat.”  “Those cells will multiply and grow, we’ll end up with exactly the same meat but produced in a much more efficient way,” he added. “Far less climate change; no contribution to antibiotic resistance.”',3),
	('y16','Some gig workers are getting $0 in unemployment benefits','Independent contractors and other self-employed workers have been confused and frustrated by a challenging and confusing process of applying for unemployment benefits.','Greg Iacurci','2020-04-24','Some gig workers may be scratching their heads at what, for many, has become a roundabout process to get unemployment benefits. In yet another wrinkle, California is issuing letters to gig workers who applied for unemployment benefits indicating that they are entitled to $0. For some, like Ismael Perez, who made about $60,000 last year as a full-time Uber and Lyft driver, the letter was confusing. “When I got the [unemployment] award letter, all it said was ‘zero’ everywhere,” said Perez, 42, who lives in La Habra Heights, California, a city in Los Angeles County. The same happened to Dexter Eng, 45, a full-time Uber driver from Campbell, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area. His award statement from the state said he was entitled to $0 in benefits. Perez, for his part, was baffled by his letter. “I thought, ‘Is this actually accurate?’” he said. The short answer, in many circumstances, is yes. “Receiving a $0 award notice doesn’t necessarily mean someone is ineligible for regular [unemployment insurance] benefits,” California’s Employment Development Department, or EDD, said in an e-mail. The situation seems to apply to a broad swath of workers in the state, encompassing full-time gig workers, self-employed individuals, independent contractors and others. Such workers living in other states may be experiencing similar confusion, based on their state’s administration of unemployment benefits. Self-employed workers, independent contractors and others are newly eligible to collect unemployment benefits as a result of the $2.2 trillion federal coronavirus relief law enacted last month.',4),

JPMorgan on late Wednesday e','Hugh Son','2020-04-23','JPMorgan Chase is warning some customers that even if fresh funds for the federal small business relief program are approved, the money won’t last and they might be better off applying elsewhere. JPMorgan on late Wednesday emailed thousands of customers who have applied to the Paycheck Protection Program to say that while Congress is headed towards replenishing the effort, the bank is concerned “that funds could run out again quickly,” according to a copy obtained by CNBC. The bank, which has been inundated with requests for more than $40 billion in loans since April 3, has placed customers in one of four categories indicating the progress of applications. Those furthest back in line are in Stage 1, and they received the starkest language: “Your application is still in Stage 1, with an extremely large volume of applications ahead yours,”  the bank said. “We wanted to give you this information, so that you can decide if you would like to try applying with another lender.” Small business customers have complained that banks, including JPMorgan, have been slow to process applications for a program that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said would result in same-day funding of loans. The furor grew after the initial $350 billion earmarked for PPP was quickly depleted and it was revealed that bigger clients, including publicly traded companies with access to capital markets, had greater success in securing loans. Even before the second round of $310 billion in PPP funding is approved by lawmakers, which is expected to happen Thursday, industry experts have said the funding could last mere days. Banks have been building an ever-growing backlog of completed applications that can be sent through the Small Business Administration’s loan portal when the program reopens. Still, business owners may face long odds if they apply at other banks, because many lenders have prioritized their own customers and new applicants would be at the end of the line. There is no guarantee that lawmakers will approve more money for the program after the second round. Last week, JPMorgan said that it had $26 billion worth of loans from hundreds of thousands of customers that needed to be funded.',4),


	('p1','Coronavirus offers Manchester Uniteds Glazer family a huge opportunity','The coronavirus pandemic has ravaged football’s finances brutally, and the worldwide implications on other economies could cause upset amongst the Glazers, or offer them a huge opportunity.','Alexander Netherton','2020-04-26','United’s current owners, before the spread of the virus, were believed to have been split 50-50 between wanting to sell the club if an appropriate offer came in, while Joel and Avi - at least - wanted to maintain control of the club.That tension might have explained the stop-start nature of the club’s management. On the one hand, they would throw out £85 million for Harry Maguire, £45 million for Aaron Wan-Bissaka and £15 million on Daniel James in the summer, and suddenly rush to secure Bruno Fernandes in the winter transfer window when it looked like their position in the top half of the league was under threat.But on the other, they would leave Jose Mourinho baffled as his reward for second place was Diogo Dalot, Lee Grant and Fred. A lack of long term strategy might also have been betrayed out by the upkeep of Old Trafford. A string of journalists complained about the poor wifi provision to those in attendance on matchday. There were leaks in some parts of the roof, and the ground has an altogether more ‘classic’ look to it compared to the modern stadia used by Marseille, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham. The size of the stadium means it remains one of the biggest in the world, but it is unable to properly accommodate supporters with disabilities, as an example of its problems. It does not need to be overhauled, but its appearance does not match the clubs reputation.	Old Trafford, like United, was ready for new owners. There was a palpable lack of ambition and of direction since Ed Woodward abandoned his own Galactico strategy. Instead, the club moved from one mistake to the next, each trying to correct the past.Saudi Arabian state owners would of course have been a miserable experience due to their wretched human rights abuses, but they presumably would have been more ambitious regarding on-the-pitch achievements. That no longer looks like a concern for either the fans, or a get-out plan for reluctant owners. Newcastle United appear to be selling to Saudi Arabia and Amanda Staveley, and unless the Glazers are willing to sell at a distressed price - which they don’t need to - there are few suitors liquid or brave enough to swoop in to buy the club now. However, coronavirus has given the family a rare chance to take advantage of their competition, should they wish to take the lead.United have around $200 million in a revolver facility - a business overdraft, essentially - that holds just a 2% interest rate. Their next debt maturity is in 2027, at which point if United cant roll that over or repay it, it will mean the rest of the world has dropped into a cocked hat of ruin, so is largely not a concern for now. What it means is that other clubs will struggle for credit, while United already have it. Given Manchester City’s troubles with UEFA and an upcoming European ban, it means that United look increasingly likely to salvage a Champions League spot next season. That broadcast money is handy, but perhaps more importantly it means that United’s sponsorship deals avoid an obligatory cut for their lack of European involvement. The club have always been relatively financially strong, but it now looks as if their competition are going to be hit far harder, beyond just local rivals City. Liverpool are well run, of course, but John Henry runs a tight ship, as proven by their initial uptake of the government furlough scheme. Stan Kroenke’s pursuit of pay cuts at Arsenal suggests they too will hunker down as best they can. Chelsea are organised and disciplined now, without the largesse of Roman Abramovich to help them dominate. Across the continent, Barcelona are in potentially dire straits. This means that the Glazers can strike out to their advantage.',10),

Carrie Dunn says that the last two years have ended in real disappointment - and whoever takes over needs to deliver success.','Carrie Dunn','2020-04-26','It wasnt the way anyone would have wanted or expected it, but Phil Nevilles departure from the role of England Lionesses manager has finally been confirmed.Hands were basically forced all round - his contract was initially due to expire in the summer of 2021, after the 2020 Olympic Games and after a home European Championships. The coronavirus pandemic now means that both competitions will be held a year later and so Neville will not lead his England side in another major tournament - and its possible if not probable he wont be coaching Team GB through the Olympics either, although there has been no decision on that one way or the other as yet. So for the next 15 months, England essentially have a lame duck coach. He might be dealing with the same admin as usual, and working with his staff to put together training packages for the squad during the footballing hiatus; but by the time England kick a ball in anger again it will be a matter of a handful of weeks until he leaves the job. Whatever philosophy and game plans he might have will be rendered irrelevant when a new manager takes over. Or perhaps not. The FA have been clear that part of the reason for the early announcement of his departure is so that he can be part of the selection committee for his replacement. This is a fairly decent and common principle in many HR departments; the person actually doing the job obviously has an insight into who will be best suited to fill their shoes. Except - and whisper this, for it goes against much of the perceived wisdom - Nevilles time as England boss has been something of a disappointment. With all the financial and staff support anyone could wish for, the Lionesses still only made the semi-finals of the Womens World Cup last year - finishing fourth, as opposed to the third place theyd achieved in 2015. (Cynics and those with long memories might wonder what Hope Powell - England manager from 1998 to 2013 - might have done given similar resources.) Since the summer of 2019, England have lost seven of their last 11 matches, and failed to defend their SheBelieves Cup title in March. When he took over, the Lionesses were the top-ranked side in Europe; now they are third. Of course, Neville had to hit the ground running. He stepped into a vacancy that had been left unfilled for several months after Mark Sampsons hurried and controversial departure in the autumn of 2017; it seemed that nobody wanted to coach a team who had won a World Cup bronze medal and just reached the semi-finals of the European Championship. There were four names that observers discussed repeatedly then - Laura Harvey, Emma Hayes, Nick Cushing and John Herdman - and all four ruled themselves out swiftly. Might one of them feel that this could be their time, a few years on? Harvey is now working in the US Soccer junior set-up, Cushing has just left Manchester City to take a job in MLS with New York City, and Herdman oversees all of Canadian mens international football. Hayes is the only one still in England, but she has been quick to point out how very happy she is at Chelsea. Neville was an unexpected choice in 2018, but he knew how the FA operated, and he was keen on the role - that was apparently enough. It might have to be the same for the person who follows him. Although Neville had the UEFA Pro Licence the FA deemed obligatory for anyone wanting to take on the job, he didnt have any experience in a head coachs role - and he certainly didnt have any experience in the womens game. He worked hard to get to know the players available to him and the way the game operated. He drew on the backing of his support staffs knowledge, and had the good fortune to be helped out by former captain Casey Stoney - now the Manchester United manager - for his first few months in situ.',10),

It would be a seemingly innocuous statement had it been written by any tennis player or fan with time to contemplate the state of the sport. Its a nice idea that has been floated more times than anyone can count. But because this time the player was Roger Federer, and the comment was made through the megaphone of Twitter during uncertain times brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, the comment gained immediate traction. The result was a groundswell of support for the Swiss icons suggestion. "You are not the only one," tweeted No. 2-ranked womens player Simona Halep. "I agree [about the need to merge], and have been saying so since the early 1970s," tennis legend Billie Jean King tweeted. "One voice, women and men together, has long been my vision for tennis. The WTA on its own was always Plan B."Rafael Nadal was among the uniformly supportive male players and tennis commentators who chimed in: "Hey @rogerfederer as you know per our discussions I completely agree that it would be great to get out of this world crisis with the union of mens and womens tennis in one only organisation." Clearly, the social distancing that the pandemic has required, along with the shutdown of economic activity, has led people to step back and take a deep breath, viewing their respective professions with fresh eyes. "When things are going very well, no one wants to give up anything in any business. You cant get anyone to focus on change," Chris Kermode, executive chairman and president of the ATP from 2014 to 2019, told ESPN.com. "You tend to get people focusing on different ideas and potential changes when theres a crisis. So necessity drives a lot of these decisions." The crisis is evident: Professional tennis came to a standstill on the eve of the Indian Wells combined event, and no ATP or WTA tournaments will be played until at least July 13, the week after Wimbledon would have ended, had it not been canceled. The economic impact of the lockdown has been profound, especially for players ranked outside the top 200.Administrators for both the ATP and WTA were developing a new interest in bridging the divide between the tours in recent months, even before the economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. At the Australian Open in January, WTA president Micky Lawler met with Andrea Gaudenzi, Kermodes successor, as well as Tennis Australia officials, to discuss ways to create a closer working relationship between the tours.

Murray underwent hip re-surfacing surgery at the start of 2019 and resumed playing doubles in June before returning to singles action in August. He did not compete at the U.S. Open but won the title in Antwerp in October -- his first on the ATP Tour for two years. Murray, 32, has not played a competitive match this year because of bone bruising near the site of his surgery. With tennis unlikely to return until at least late July because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Scot has plenty of time to get himself 100% fit for when play resumes. Yet Rusedski says it will be tough for twice Wimbledon champion Murray to regain his former place in the so-called big four of mens tennis alongside Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic. "The good news for him is that hes had more of a rest at this point," Rusedski told Sky Sports on Sunday. "Hopefully his body comes back, but to challenge week in week out with Nadal, Federer, Djokovic, [Stefanos] Tsitsipas is going to be hard. "Can he win matches? Can he possibly win a Tour event? Yes, he can do so. But to win Slams, thats three out of five sets, seven matches, thats a little bit difficult. Its possible he can get to a quarterfinal, fourth round, but to go all the way with the surgeries hes had, thats a big ask. "But I hope he proves me wrong, like hes done on several occasions."

It was around 4:30 p.m. local time on March 8 when Petra Kvitova landed in Los Angeles. The two-time Wimbledon champion collected her bags and headed to a car, bound for Indian Wells and the first big North American hard-court event of 2020, the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells. Kvitova was about an hour into the three-hour journey to Palm Springs, California, when she received a message from her agent, Marijn Bal, and her press agent, Katie Spellman, telling her that Indian Wells had been canceled because of COVID-19. "It was very weird," Kvitova told ESPN.com via email. Spellman, who also manages Simona Halep, had arrived a few hours earlier and, soon after, the rumors started to fly."There were already rumblings around site about it potentially being canceled, mainly because someone had tested positive for COVID-19 in the Coachella Valley that day," Spellman told ESPN.com. "Suddenly it became much more real for everyone on site; the whole tournament site was set up, everybody was arriving, lots of players were there. This news was kind of breaking all around us. "There was a huge meeting of everybody on site, including players, happening downstairs. We saw everybody come out of that meeting and then the news spread very quickly that it had been canceled. It felt like a huge shock at that point, because it was the first tournament to be canceled and the players were all on site and, yes, everybody was a little bit miffed that wed gone all that way to be there, not realizing at the time how serious the situation was very quickly going to become." The speed of the decision took many by surprise. A few days before, the tournament had announced that it would be taking a number of special measures in light of the developing pandemic. Ball boys and girls would wear gloves and not handle players towels, while the players were advised not to take pens from fans for autographs. Many players found out on social media and though they understood the decision, they were not too impressed by the manner in which they were told. "It would be nice if [the] ATP Tour communicates a bit better to the players about a suspension of such a tournament when we are all here," Argentinian Diego Schwartzman said via Twitter. "Finding out about it on social networks or WhatsApp is quite loose." Halep had pulled out of the event with a foot injury, so she was home in Romania. But Kvitova and many others were left to wait to find out whether the Miami Open, the next stop on tour, would go ahead or suffer the same fate. The Indian Wells Tennis Garden quickly went into lockdown, with journalists and photographers not allowed through the gates, and players and coaches were left in limbo, wondering whether to stay or go home immediately. "Even if there was no tournament, we still had a lot of marketing shoots and everything to do, plus we had to wait and see what would happen with Miami," Kvitova said. For a while, it seemed that Miami might sneak in before the cull. Discussions continued behind the scenes over the next few days, but on March 11 the decision by the World Health Organization that COVID-19 was a pandemic sped things along. On March 12, even while The Players Championship golf event was beginning at nearby Sawgrass the same day, the ATP announced that it was suspending its tour for six weeks. Miami, Houston, Marrakech, Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Budapest were all canceled. Kvitova had been doing promotional shoots for the WTA, Wilson and Nike, among others, in Indian Wells, but as soon as she heard the Miami news, she arranged to fly home. "In those few short days there, everything changed and the world locked down pretty quickly," she said. "We had to rush to get home and had to drive home from Vienna as our connection into Prague got canceled." As players scrambled for flights home, officials were holding talks behind the scenes. "(Indian Wells) was a huge decision and we did realize the magnitude of it and how it would likely lead to other decisions," WTA CEO Steve Simon told ESPN via email. "The tournament did everything they could and had all the conversations to see if the event could happen, but in the end it was deemed the best decision was for it to not be held. It turned out to clearly be the right decision. "A focused and concerted effort around communication and education then followed, with all of our members. The world changed overnight with respect to the decision that was made and we had to communicate as effectively and quickly as we could to our players, tournaments, partners, staff and fans." The new ATP chief, Andrea Gaudenzi, said players and administrators had mulled over the idea of playing the event."It was something we discussed in Indian Wells because the players were already on site (but) we couldnt guarantee the safety of people on site, not only players but ball boys, linesmen, physios, everyone who was there," Gaudenzi told ATP Tennis Radio. While the ATP and WTA discussed their plans, events moved forward with pace, most notably with the shocking announcement from Roland Garros that the French Open was moving this years event from the traditional May-June dates to Sept. 20 to Oct. 4.That meant it would start just a week after the US Open finished, and the manner of the announcement did not go over well with the other Grand Slam events, as well as the ATP and WTA.',11)
